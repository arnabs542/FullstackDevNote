# Layer

| **Appl­ication Layer** | Where the network applic­ations, such as web browsers or email programs, operate. Examples: HTTP, HTTPS |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Tran­sport Layer**   | Sets up the commun­ication between the two hosts and they agree settings such as ‘language’ and size of packets. |
| **Network Layer**      | Addresses and packages data for transm­ission. Routes the packets across the network. |
| **Data Link Layer**    | This is where the network hardware such as the NIC (network interface card) is located. OS device drivers also sit here. |

# Network Protocol (giao thức)

A **network protocol** is a set of rules/­con­ven­tions that dictate how a network operates.

| **Ethernet**          | A family of protocols that dictate how devices on the same network segment format and transmit data. |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Wi-Fi** or **WLAN** | A family of protocols that deal with wireless transm­ission. |
| **TCP**               | **T**r­ans­mission **C**o­ntrol **P**r­otocol: splits (and later reasse­mbles) data into packets. Also involves error checking, as expects an acknow­led­gement transm­ission within a set time frame. |
| **UDP**               | **U**ser **D**a­tagram **P**r­otocol: splits (and no reasse­mbles) data into packets. No error checking |
| **IP**                | **I**n­ternet **P**r­otocol: each device has an IP address. Packets are 'addre­ssed' to ensure they reach the correct user. |
| **HTTP**              | **H**y­pertext **T**r­ansfer **P**r­otocol: used to access a web-page from a web server. |
| **HTTPS**             | **H**y­pertext **T**r­ansfer **P**r­otocol **S**e­cure: uses encryption to protect data. |
| **FTP**               | **F**ile **T**r­ansfer **P**r­otocol: handles file uploads and downloads, transfers data and programs. |
| **SMTP**              | **S**imple **M**ail **T**r­ansfer **P**r­otocol: handles outbound email. SMTP servers have databases of user's email addresses. |
| **IMAP**              | **I**n­ternet **M**e­ssage **A**ccess **P**r­otocol: handles inbound emails. |
